# exchange_cpp
Learning C++ by making a pseudo-exchange. 

Compile by running: 'make'
Start server by running: ./server <port>
Start client by running: ./client <host> <port>

To run an automated testing script that starts a server, and 3 clients and sends 100 random commands from each client, run ./test_exchange
